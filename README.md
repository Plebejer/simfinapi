This package wraps the https://simfin.com/ API to make SimFin data easily available in R. To obtain a SimFin API key (and thus to use this package), you need to register at https://simfin.com/login. 

To do:

- make API calls saver: Capture error and throw useful warning.
- allow for api calls via ticker (instead of SimId)
